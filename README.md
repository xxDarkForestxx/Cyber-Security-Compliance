# Cyber-Security-Compliance
In this imaginary and hypothetical scenario we evaluate a company that has recently exploded in popularity. We will be auditing their policies and procedures to see if they are complying to common regulatory practices in regards to NISTS CyberSecurity framework. 
The First part will be the checklist of what they are implimenting followed by the scenario of what they have actually done. Lastly we will talk about some reconmendations they can impliment to remediate their security issues and come into compliance with the regulatory bodies of the law.
